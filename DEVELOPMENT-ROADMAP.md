# 🚀 Orchestrator MCP: Complete Development Roadmap

## 📍 **Current Status: Architecture Complete, Implementation Needed**

**Date**: July 4, 2025  
**Milestone**: ✅ Modular Refactoring Complete | 🚨 TODO Implementation Required

---

## 🎉 **What We Just Accomplished**

### **✅ Major Architecture Success**
- **Transformed monolithic codebase** into clean modular architecture
- **Reduced file complexity** from 500+ lines to focused modules
- **Implemented planned structure** from alternative-plan.md exactly
- **Maintained 100% functionality** during refactoring
- **Verified all systems operational** with 9 MCP servers (82+ tools)

### **✅ Quality Assurance Verified**
- TypeScript builds without errors
- All MCP server connections working
- AI orchestration functional
- Tool delegation operational
- Backward compatibility maintained

---

## 🚨 **Critical Discovery: TODO Implementation Gap**

### **Audit Results**
- **7 files** contain TODO comments and placeholder implementations
- **24 core functions** return "Not implemented" or empty data
- **Intelligence layer** completely non-functional (placeholders only)
- **Server integrations** missing enhanced functionality

### **Impact Assessment**
- **User Experience**: Many advertised features don't work
- **AI Capabilities**: Intelligence analysis returns empty results
- **Enhanced Operations**: Server integrations provide no added value
- **Production Readiness**: System not ready for real-world use
