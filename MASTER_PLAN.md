2. **Orchestration**: Multi-server workflows solving complex problems
3. **Context**: Building knowledge and insights over time
4. **Automation**: Reducing manual work through intelligent automation

### **Target User Experience**
- **"Analyze my codebase"** ‚Üí Real insights using filesystem + AI analysis

## üö® **Implementation Gap Analysis**

### **What Needs Implementation (24 placeholder functions)**
- **Intelligence Layer**: 7 files with TODO comments returning fake data
- **Server Integrations**: 4 files with "Not implemented" functions
- **Enhanced Operations**: Missing value-added features beyond basic delegation

### **Impact Assessment**
- **User Experience**: Many advertised features don't work
- **Value Proposition**: No differentiation from individual MCP servers
- **Production Readiness**: Core works, but enhanced features are placeholders

## üö® **URGENT: Operational Issues Discovered (July 4, 2025)**

### **Testing Context**
‚úÖ **Major Success**: All 10 MCP servers connected successfully and core functionality works
‚úÖ **Individual Tools**: Playwright, Puppeteer, Fetch, Memory, Filesystem all working correctly
‚úÖ **AI Orchestration**: Basic AI coordination and tool delegation functional

### **Issues Identified During Live Testing**
During comprehensive testing of all 10 MCP servers, several operational issues were discovered that need immediate attention:

#### **üî¥ High Priority (Blocking Core Functionality)**
1. **Context/Path Management Issues**
   - AI orchestration not providing proper working directory context to tools
   - File operations failing due to missing or incorrect path information
   - Git operations failing because of context confusion
   - **Impact**: Filesystem, git, and path-dependent operations unreliable

2. **Tool Parameter Validation Failures**
   - Tools receiving invalid or undefined parameters
   - "Invalid arguments" errors in sequential thinking and file operations
   - Missing required parameters not caught before tool execution
   - **Impact**: Random tool failures, poor user experience

3. **Workflow Error Handling Gaps**
   - Complex multi-step workflows failing completely on single tool errors
   - No graceful degradation when tools timeout or fail
   - Partial workflow results not preserved or reported
   - **Impact**: Complex operations unreliable, no partial success feedback

#### **üü° Medium Priority (Affecting Reliability)**
4. **Timeout Configuration Issues**
   - Semgrep filesystem search timing out on large codebases
   - No configurable timeouts for different operation types
   - Some operations need longer timeouts than others
   - **Impact**: Large project analysis fails, inconsistent performance

5. **Network Connectivity Problems**
   - DuckDuckGo search experiencing connection timeouts
   - OpenRouter API calls occasionally failing
   - No retry logic for transient network issues
   - **Impact**: External integrations unreliable
